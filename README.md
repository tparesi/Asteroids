# Asteroids

The beginning of a browser based Asteroids game.

The logic for colliding objects, along with moving/wrapping asteroids, a ship class, and a bullet class. 

Currently, the ship can fly, but the bullets are non-functional. The next steps in this project are:

- [ ] Add working fire bullet function
- [ ] Add bullet collisions with asteroids
- [ ] Add asteroid breaking functionality
- [ ] Track score
